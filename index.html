				<h2>Knitting, Wikipedia article</h2>
				<p>Dogs are amazing animals with some interesting facts! They have been our companions for thousands of years, dating back to ancient times. Dogs come in many shapes and sizes, from tiny Chihuahuas to huge Great Danes. They have an incredible sense of smell, which is much better than ours, allowing them to detect scents from far away. Dogs also have an excellent hearing ability and can hear sounds at frequencies that are too high for us to detect. They are known for their loyalty and can form strong bonds with their owners. Plus, they love to play and can learn many tricks and commands through training!
